## What is the main reason behind most societal problems?

It’s not aligning with natural laws & the creation of **artificial scarcity**.

We are born into a system that isn’t naturally aligned, which is why it can feel suffocating. Society is built on roles, regulations, procedures, rules, comparisons, validations—none of which feel harmonious with our innate rhythms.

## What do we really need?

We just need our basic essentials, and the freedom to do what we love and contribute—that’s it. But society has made that seem difficult, normalizing the chase for false goals.

Society has infiltrated our minds and created artificial desires, trapping our time and energy bit by bit.

Living in a soul-aligned way is hard in this reality because majority opinion is engineered. Society makes the wrong things appear right, pressuring people to conform.

If we reimagine these systems and rebuild society differently, we can free ourselves—and that’s our natural state.

## Main areas that create artificial scarcity

- **Healthcare**
- **Education**
- **Media**
- **Money & Banking**
- **Energy & Oil**
- **Military**
- **Government**
- **Corporations**

These sectors preserve their interests and profits by maintaining the status quo. Wars, systemic blueprints, and restrictions—including on indigenous lands—help them continue.

### Example: Medical Sciences

Natural healing methods already exist but are often suppressed by modern medical structures, which act like a new form of priesthood. If a natural solution exists at negligible cost, it becomes a threat.

- Chronic illnesses, diagnostic labels, insurance systems—these profit from ongoing problems rather than solutions.
- Practices like naturopathy, Ayurveda, and holistic healing are real and valid, yet often marginalized.
- The media helps reinforce prejudice against indigenous wisdom because it undermines mainstream profit models.

### Example: Education

Our natural learning is rooted in curiosity, intuition, creativity, and critical thinking. Yet the current system emphasizes:

- Obedience
- Rule-following
- Permission-seeking
- Remembering what to think—not how to think

Children’s autonomy is eroded when they're told when to speak, move, or even use the toilet.

Across industries, natural ways are made to seem odd—and artificial systems normal—through engineered consent.

Suppress imagination → enforce conformity → eliminate alternatives. That's the root of many societal problems.

## The Solution: Decentralisation & Self-Sufficiency

Scarcity is an illusion.  
Abundance is our natural state.

If we can freely share what we have, nobody gets left behind.
